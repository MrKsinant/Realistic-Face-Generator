# Realistic Face Generator

This study corresponds to the fourth project of the nanodegree *Deep Learning*, schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** (https://eu.udacity.com), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

Its goal is to provide a deep learning algorithm that can **generate realistic faces**: To achieve this objective a GAN (generative adversarial network) has been used.

In this repository, you will find the following files and folders:
* The file ***realistic-face-generator.ipynb***, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the detailed and explained study, accompanied by the results obtained;
* The file *realistic_face_unittests.py*, a collection of unit tests for functions written for the study;
* The file *workspace_utils.py*, which contains specific code to run programs properly inside Udacity working environments;
* The folder *assets*, which contains the only image used to illustrate the study;
* The folder *training*, which contains the files generated during the training session of the neural network (due to the weight of the generated models, *D.pth* and *G.pth*, these files haven't been provided).

Finally, to conclude, respectively to the requirements, it can be said that the deep learning model built within this study has been constructed thanks to **PyTorch** (https://pytorch.org), the deep learning framework mainly supported and developed by **Facebook** and its **FAIR** (Facebook AI Research) team (https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/).
